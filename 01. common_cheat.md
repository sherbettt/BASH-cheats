# ssh
# OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

# SSH in via PEM file, which normally needs 0600 permissions.
ssh -i /path/to/file.pem user@example.com

# Connect through a non-standard port. It's recommended not to use the default
# port of 22, as it is so often targeted, due to it being so commonplace.
ssh -p 2222 user@example.com

# Connect and forward the authentication agent.
ssh -A user@example.com

# Execute a command on a remote server.
ssh -t user@example.com 'the-remote-command'

# Tunnel an X session over SSH, via X11 Forwarding.
ssh -X user@example.com

# Redirect traffic with a tunnel between local host (port 8080) and a remote
# host (remote.example.com:5000) through a proxy (personal.server.com).
ssh -f -L 8080:remote.example.com:5000 user@personal.server.com -N

# Launch a specific X application over SSH.
ssh -X -t user@example.com 'chromium-browser'

# Create a SOCKS proxy on localhost and port 9999.
ssh -D 9999 user@example.com

# Connect to server, but allow for X11 forwarding, while also using Gzip
# compression (can be much faster; YMMV), and using the `blowfish` encryption.
# For more information, see: http://unix.stackexchange.com/q/12755/44856
ssh -XCc blowfish user@example.com

# Copy files and directories, via SSH, from remote host to the current working
# directory, with Gzip compression. An option for when `rsync` isn't available.
#
# This works by creating (not temporary!) a remote Tar archive, then piping its
# output to a local Tar process, which then extracts it to STDOUT.
ssh user@example.com 'tar -C /var/www/Shared/ zcf - asset1 asset2' | tar zxf -

# Explicitly specify a key for connection. Useful if you have too many
# authentication failures for a given username.
ssh -i some_id_rsa -o IdentitiesOnly=yes them@there:/path/

# Temporarily disable `pubkey` authentication for this instance.
ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no username@hostname.com

# Mount a remote directory or filesystem, through SSH, to a local mount point.
# Install SSHFS from: https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs
sshfs name@server:/path/to/folder /path/to/mount/point

# EMACS can read files through SSH. Below, is a link to related documentation.

# ssh
# Secure Shell is a protocol used to securely log onto remote systems.
# It can be used for logging or executing commands on a remote server.
# More information: <https://man.openbsd.org/ssh>.

# Connect to a remote server:
ssh username@remote_host

# Connect to a remote server with a specific identity (private key):
ssh -i path/to/key_file username@remote_host

# Connect to a remote server using a specific port:
ssh username@remote_host -p 2222

# Run a command on a remote server with a [t]ty allocation allowing interaction with the remote command:
ssh username@remote_host -t command command_arguments

# SSH tunneling: Dynamic port forwarding (SOCKS proxy on `localhost:1080`):
ssh -D 1080 username@remote_host

# SSH tunneling: Forward a specific port (`localhost:9999` to `example.org:80`) along with disabling pseudo-[T]ty allocation and executio[N] of remote commands:
ssh -L 9999:example.org:80 -N -T username@remote_host

# SSH jumping: Connect through a jumphost to a remote server (Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters):
ssh -J username@jump_host username@remote_host

# Agent forwarding: Forward the authentication information to the remote machine (see `man ssh_config` for available options):
ssh -A username@remote_host
